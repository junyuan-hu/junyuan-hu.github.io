      "summary": "Stereoselective synthesis utilizing small-molecule catalysts, particularly N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), 
      has facilitated swift access to enantioenriched molecules through diverse activation modes and NHC-bound reactive 
      intermediates. While carbonyl derivatives, imines, and “activated” alkenes have been extensively investigated, the 
      exploration of heteroatom-centered analogues of NHC-bound intermediates has long been neglected, despite the
      significant potential for novel chemical transformations they offer once recognized. Herein, we disclose a 
      carbene-catalyzed new activation mode by generating unique sulfinyl azolium intermediates from carbene nucleophilic
      addition to in situ-generated mixed sulfinic anhydride intermediates. Combined experimental and computational 
      mechanistic investigations pinpoint the chiral NHC-catalyzed formation of sulfinyl azolium intermediate as the 
      enantio-determining step. The novel “S”-based carbene reactive intermediate imparts high efficiency for the catalytic
      construction of sulfur-stereogenic compounds, giving rise to sulfinate esters with high yields and enantioselectivities
      under mild conditions. Notably, distinct from most of the NHC-catalyzed enantioselective transformations focusing on
      the “C” central chiral products, our study realizes a unique carbene-catalyst control over chiral “S” stereocenters
      via direct asymmetric S–O bond formation for the first time. Furthermore, these sulfinyl-containing products could
      serve as versatile synthetic platforms for enantioenriched S-stereogenic functional molecules and exhibit remarkable
      antibacterial activities against rice plant pathogens, which is valuable for the development of novel agrochemical 
      agents."
