Enantioenriched phosphorus(V)-stereogenic compounds, featuring a pentavalent phosphorus atom as the stereogenic center, are crucial in various natural products, drugs, bioactive molecules, and catalysts/ligands. While a handful of stereoselective synthetic approaches have been developed, achieving direct stereocontrol at the phosphorus atom through catalytic generation of phosphorus(V)-heteroatom bonds continues to be a formidable challenge. Here, we disclose an organocatalytic asymmetric condensation strategy that employs a novel activation mode of stable feedstock phosphinic acids by the formation of mixed phosphinic anhydride as the reactive species to facilitate further catalyst-controlled asymmetric P–O bond formations, involving a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) process with alcohol nucleophiles via a cinchonidine-derived bifunctional catalyst. The resulting H-phosphinate intermediates allow further stereospecific derivatizations, affording modular access to a diverse library of chiral phosphonates and phosphonamidates with notable antibacterial activity. Furthermore, this synthetic platform facilitates P–O/N coupling with various natural products and drugs, presenting a valuable tool for medicine and agrochemical discovery.
